      <updated>2021-08-11T14:30:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/ec2-ssh</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ec2-ssh">&lt;p&gt;This is a long story so I will leave out extra details to keep it (somewhat) brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working with an AWS EC2 instance with wordpress installed. When you host your own wordpress sites, you need to keep up with server maintenance. I needed to update the PHP version for security reasons and I found a tutorial that told me to update ubuntu first. Once the update was complete, I no longer had ssh access to my EC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing some reading, I believe this happened because there is some kind of a breaking change in the ssh config between ubuntu versions 16.04 and 18.04.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most users who have the physical device in front of them it is not difficult to run a few commands on their machine and repair the config issue. For me, however, my only access at the time was through ssh. I could not fix ssh and access the files on my machine until I had a command line or c-panel to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of trial an error I eventually regained access. I will share the process here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-things-that-didnt-work&quot;&gt;The things that didn’t work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I’ll list what I tried that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; work. To be fair, though, it’s possible that some of these could work for someone else, as there is plenty of documentation for these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;checked security groups to ensure ssh access still available on port 22 (it was)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;added new security group with new port (1022) and try to ssh using it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;created a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; AMI based on current EC2 instance, and launched an entirely new instance from it - still no ssh acces on new one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched a new instance from an &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; AMI that was created before I updated ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stopped the current instance, detached the EBS volume, reattached it, and restarted the instance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;added user data script to restart ssh (method 4 in this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-resolve-ssh-connection-errors/&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-resolve-ssh-connection-errors/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ran the troubleshoot ssh automation document (method 3 in this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-resolve-ssh-connection-errors/&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-resolve-ssh-connection-errors/&lt;/a&gt;), hoping to find some clues as to the root of the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tried to set up EC2 connect - only works on nitro-based instances, and I wasn’t able to update my instance to a nitro-based system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about ready to give up, but there was one more method I had not tried - setting up session manager&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-session-manager-way&quot;&gt;The session manager way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While attempting all of the above processes I came across this option. There were a lot of steps in the documentation I read at that time and it seemed a bit intimidating to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I revisited it again while on the “connect” page in EC2. On this page there are tabs with several options to connect to your instance. Connecting via session manager was one of these options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dismissed it earlier because it said I couldn’t connect. This time I paid attention to the possible reasons why the connection wasn’t being made. One possibility was that the proper IAM policy wasn’t attached, which could be added using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html#start-ec2-console&quot;&gt;“quick set-up”&lt;/a&gt; in systems manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I gave it a try and followed along in the quick set-up console and chose an EC2 related configuration. When I returned to the EC2 connection session manager tab the warnings were gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time when I clicked “connect”, I got command line access to the EC2!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when I ran the “pwd” linux command I was a bit lost in the file system. Signing in via session manager didn’t take me directly into the wordpress folders like it did on ssh login. Since now I could run commands I decided to troubleshoot ssh access once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a command to test ssh &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo sshd -t&lt;/code&gt; which unfortunatly didn’t provide anything useful for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information that I believe helped me the most was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.bitnami.com/t/ssh-stops-working-after-upgrade-to-ubuntu-18-04-on-aws-lightsail/64821/7&quot;&gt;this article on the bitnami community page&lt;/a&gt;, which addressed essentially the same problem I was having, just on AWS Lightsail. As Lightsail is built on EC2, I thought this might help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suggested, as I suspected from earlier research, that the ssh config was the issue. They said to run these commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  sudo sed -i 's/^Ciphers .*/Ciphers +aes256-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes128-cbc/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  sudo service sshd stop
  sudo service sshd start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say for sure these were the exact steps that solved my problem, since I ran some other commands around this time in session manager. But after running the above commands I tried to ssh into my instance again, and it worked. Mostly likely it was this attempt that fixed it since it’s the only one that addresses the config problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be the most frustrating problem I’ve had to deal with yet in my dev journey. I’ve been stuck before many times but this was the closest I’ve been to running out of ideas and abandoning the project. Thankfully I was able to push through and that didn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit to working through this problem was that it forced me to dive deep into EC2. It helped to solidify my knowledge on EC2 and expose me to other AWS services. In addition, I learned more about linux systems, which was quite interesting for me since I don’t work with them often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, this was a great learning opportunity. And I’m now very happy to move on.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">Debugging front-end graph libraries - recharts</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/debugging-graphs" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Debugging front-end graph libraries - recharts" />
      <published>2021-08-06T14:30:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2021-08-06T14:30:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/debugging-graphs</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/debugging-graphs">&lt;p&gt;My company does a lot of data analytics, which means on the front end we work with a lot of graphs. Today I’ll talk about some difficulties I had debugging a new dashboard on our platform, which was built using recharts graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-task&quot;&gt;The task&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed a set of graphs to represent some new metrics. Without giving away what the graph is actually communicating, I’ll say the x-axis went from “good” on the left side, to “bad” on the far right. We wanted a gradient going from left to right, changing from a “good” colour to a “bad” colour, to represent this concept and help users visually see the problems they are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with an Area chart in the recharts sandbox. The gradient was quick to figure out and I ended up with a nice blue-purple-orange gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a gradient with recharts, you need to put the code under “defs”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;defs&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;linearGradient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;uv&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;x1=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;y1=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;x2=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;y2=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;offset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;5%&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#008eff&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopOpacity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{0.9}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;offset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;40%&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#833f97&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopOpacity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{0.9}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;offset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;95%&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#ff4800&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopOpacity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{0.9}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/linearGradient&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/defs&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You use the “id” field inside the linearGradient tag inside the Area tag property “fill”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Area&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;monotone&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;percent&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#8884d8&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;url(#uv)&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looked great, so I copied it into my code and tried it out in the proper dashboard in our app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem was, in the app, there was no gradient - the area fill was just gray.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-i-tried&quot;&gt;Things I tried&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I tried inputing other values into the “fill” property, including colour names like “red” or “blue”. These colours worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure if using gradients was a recently added feature in recharts, so I checked what version of recharts we had. Our package.json had an old beta version of recharts, while the sandbox had the newest version. I updated our version and re-installed. Upon starting the app I saw the same problem - no gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it wasn’t just the recharts version - we had an old version of react, react-scripts, and react-dom. I went through the process of trying to update these to a new version, but did not complete it, as I had a lot of conflicting versions of packages. I just re-installed the original versions, with the exception of the updated recharts, as the new version didn’t affect our app negatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These graphs were nested inside many components, so I tried taking the AreaChart code and pasting it at the top of the code for our main overview page. Unexpectedly, the graph had a gradient! This told me there wasn’t anything wrong with the versions of my packages at this point, and the problem was within my app itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the actual dashboard page, I tried putting the graph in different places. Strangely, the gradient showed up when the graph was placed higher up on the page, but not when it was further down the page. I placed my graph at the very top of the dashboard, and I noticed that while this gradient worked, one of the old graphs below was losing its gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to put two graphs with gradients on the same page. This should work fine, except the linear gradient ids for both graphs were the same - neither I nor the previous developer had changed the id names when we copied the code from recharts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;//below, id=&quot;uv&quot;. both gradients had this same id

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;linearGradient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;uv&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;x1=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;y1=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;x2=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;y2=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;offset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;5%&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#008eff&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopOpacity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{0.9}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;offset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;40%&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#833f97&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopOpacity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{0.9}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;offset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;95%&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopColor=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#ff4800&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stopOpacity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{0.9}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/linearGradient&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both graphs were trying to use a linear gradient with id=”uv”. This caused the bug, since ids are supposed to be unique, and the graph lower on the page didn’t know which gradient it needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was easily fixed by updating the ids to unique values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of wish I didn’t have to go through all that work before figuring out this simple issue, but at least in the future when I see a similar problem I’ll have a better idea of where to look first.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">Dealing with memory leaks</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/memoryleaks" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dealing with memory leaks" />
      <published>2020-08-10T18:30:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-08-10T18:30:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/memoryleaks</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/memoryleaks">&lt;p&gt;While working on a particularly difficult task at work I ended up learning a lot about memory leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am actually still working on this task.  To summarize, I needed to create a button that copies items in a table. We are using the javascript library Knockout.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knockout.js came out in 2010 before other similar libraries like React had come onto the scene. It was very promising at the time and gained a lot of interest from developers because it was able to observe the UI for changes from the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still getting to know Knockout and React, but so far I have found my experience with React to be a more pleasant one. React just makes more sense to me in how the library is used and structured, and it is more optimized for performance.  Knockout, on the other hand, is not fully optimized in this regard and there are very specific, advanced fixes required to solve the problems you may face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not meaning to bash Knockout, and I am sure there is more for me to learn to improve my experience with it, but I do find it unnecessarily frustrating at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back to my specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured out the original logic for my button early on when I was assigned this task. To be honest even this took me a while; deciphering other peoples’ (uncommented!) code is what proved to be the most challenging aspect at that point in time. It was basically two nested loops - the outer loop determines where in the table the &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; of copies will go, and the inner loop inserts the &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; copies into the correct place in the table.  This worked great on small tables, let’s say smaller than 20 items. But once I started using it on tables that contained 100s of items, the browser crashed. It ran out of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My classmates from my web dev program suggested a while back, for a different task, that I get to know the chrome developer tools. I decided to go more in depth and start learning how to use the performance profiler and the memory tab. I also started doing more research into memory leaks in general and this is what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;javascript-memory-management&quot;&gt;Javascript memory management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript automatically manages memory, allocating slots of memory when you declare variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garbage collection(GC)&lt;/strong&gt; is automatic memory management, which monitors how memory is being allocated, and reclaims memory that is no longer being used. Javascript uses GC, where other languages like C and C++ do not have this built in. You have to allocate memory manually when using these languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just because javascript has garbage collection doesn’t mean you will never encounter issues with memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript and GC algorithms keep track of references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reference counting: if an object has no other objects referencing it, it is no longer needed. It is sent to the garbage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Circular references: if you have references referring to each other. They can never be garbage collected. Even if the values are deleted, the references still exist in memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark and sweep algorithm: instead of looking at which objects are no longer needed, objects that are “no longer reachable” are garbage collected. It starts from the javascript root and works its way outward, finding all the references from there. If something cannot be reached in this case, it is garbage collected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at your memory graph in dev tools, when analyzing performance, you may see a saw-tooth pattern. This can sometimes indicate a memory leak, because the javascript heap keeps increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heap:&lt;/strong&gt; the pool of memory used to satisfy requests for memory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-my-issue-was-solved&quot;&gt;How my issue was solved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time just learning about memory and was pretty stuck.  Of course, the examples from the dev tools instructions are pretty simple, but the application I’m working on is complex. I sent some of my performance profiles and heap snapshots to one of the senior devs. He said that it looked like too many &lt;em&gt;subscriptions&lt;/em&gt; are being made, and few are being &lt;em&gt;disposed&lt;/em&gt; of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In knockout, you can &lt;strong&gt;subscribe&lt;/strong&gt; to elements in your UI so you will be notified of any changes. Subscriptions can also be &lt;strong&gt;disposed&lt;/strong&gt; of when they are no longer needed.  It looked like I had to manually make these fixes, while they are most often taken care of automatically in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was happening was, every time we were making a new copy in the table, a new subscription was being made, and this was taking up space in memory. This is because we were adding new copies to an observable array, not a plain javascript array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;copied the observable array with all the original data into a new regular javascript array&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;added the new copies to the regular array&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;replaced the content of the observable array with the contents of the regular array; this is the stage when the subscription occured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we had only one subscription event, rather than a potential 100 or 1000. The speed improved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still a number of bugs to work out with this task, but I learned a lot about memory management just from working on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New jekyll site part 3 - errors with deployment" />
      <published>2020-04-08T16:03:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-04-08T16:03:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-3</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-3">&lt;p&gt;I made my changes to CSS without any more problems and I cleaned up my markdown files, as I mentioned last time. I figured now would be as good a time as any to deploy. I can keep adding posts and making small adjustments once deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there have been errors with this as well. As expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my github repo and pushed my code using command line. I used the following commands and this worked without errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git init&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git add .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git commit -m “first commit”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git remote add origin https://github.com/jchack1/julia-blog2.git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git push -u origin master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to deploy with Netlify, which is my go to for any deployment. It’s usually pretty straightforward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/&quot;&gt;and you can find the instructions for deploying Jekyll with Netlify here.&lt;/a&gt;  I selected my github repo and clicked deploy. After a few minutes I got an error, saying the build failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is because Netlify was looking for the _site folder.  I checked my files and I saw that I did not have this.  By now I’m getting pretty frustrated with this theme because it feels like there was a lot missing and unexplained. Why isn’t there a _site folder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; looking for any information about the _site folder.  I saw that when you use the command “jekyll build”, Jekyll builds the site and outputs it to a directory called _site, which is viewable in the browser at localhost:4000. I have used the “jekyll build” command many times so far, so I was unsure why it’s not in my files.  And why I was able to serve my site to localhost:4000.  I decided to see what would happen if I make a new Jekyll folder from scratch and run “jekyll build”. In my previous sites I always had a _site folder and never gave any thought to how it was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I decided to just follow my old notes rather than just copy-paste from my theme. I went into the Jekyll folder I already have on my machine and opened command line. I used the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jekyll new julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cd julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bundle exec jekyll build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the files in the folders and there it was. Once I used the jekyll build command, my _site folder appeared. Perhaps this was my mistake from the beginning. I never intiallized my folder properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to check both folders now, to see if I could either update my blog scripts to create the _site file, or if I’d need to copy everything over into my new folder. Whatever I tried in my old folder did not work, so I ended up copying everything over into my new folder. I set up gulp, which was really quick this time since I knew what I was doing. When I executed “bundle exec jekyll build” I now ended up with a _site folder, and it was filled with the proper files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will upload this new folder to github and deploy. It should work now that I have a proper _site folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have to remember to always “bundle exec jekyll build” and “bundle exec jekyll serve”(to generate files in _site folder) when I make changes. But only after I execute “gulp”. Hopefully I will quickly get used to this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New jekyll site part 2 - errors with Gulp" />
      <published>2020-04-04T17:31:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-04-04T17:31:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-2</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-2">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from my last post, where I began to describe the process of making this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m at the point of self-isolation where I’m starting to forget what day it is.  I believe I spent the past 3 days or so trying to figure out this problem, though at this point I’ve lost track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left off describing my issue of CSS not compiling the way I expected it to.  I admit I should have checked the instructions on the Jasper2 theme’s github in the very beginning so I would be aware that they use gulp. I followed the instructions to install gulp, but it still didn’t work. I spent many more hours fiddling around with it, then I decided to look up a tutorial on gulp in case my issue was simply not knowing enough about gulp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw that gulp utilizes command line.  You can create functions in your gulpfile.js that can be executed in the command line; in my case, the gulpfile was already created. Below is an example function that was included with my theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'build'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* cb */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodemonServerInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is a gulp task, named build.  To run this code I would type “gulp build” in the command line. If you name a task “default”, all you need to type in command line is “gulp”, and your default task is run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I learned this I was getting much closer to figuring out my problem.  However when I ran “gulp” or “gulp build”, I got an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;fs.js:27
const { Math, Object } = primordials;
                         ^

ReferenceError: primordials is not defined&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched online for a solution to this error as kind of a last ditch effort. Up until this point, I could not find any solutions at all, and there were no issues of this kind brought up by users on Jasper2’s github page.  Of course, stack overflow gave me a solution, which I would never have thought of myself unless I looked it up. I believe it was the second answer on this page that helped me: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55921442/how-to-fix-referenceerror-primordials-is-not-defined-in-node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that the node.js and gulp versions were incompatible. Remember my last post, where I wondered if I had an issue with my package versions? In a way I was right, just not in the way I expected. Node version 11.5 and higher, and gulp 3.9.1 are not compatible. This version of gulp depends on graceful-fs version 3.0.0, which is something I’m still unfamiliar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this I had to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add the below code to my package.json, and run “npm install” in command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;preinstall&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;npx npm-force-resolutions&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;resolutions&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;graceful-fs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;4.2.3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this just to be able to tweak the CSS in my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I make a change to CSS, I execute the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gulp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I really want to be thorough, I will add in “bundle exec jekyll build” before I serve the site)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there is a way to make gulp watch for changes, but I haven’t figured out how to make that work with jekyll. For now though this works just fine, despite the extra typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Now I think it’s time to finally make my changes to CSS, as well as research markdown in order to clean up my blog posts.  See you in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">The importance of a hard refresh</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/importance-of-hard-refresh" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The importance of a hard refresh" />
      <published>2020-04-02T12:12:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-04-02T12:12:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/importance-of-hard-refresh</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/importance-of-hard-refresh">&lt;p&gt;Recently I was working on a task for my practicum.  The task was to add a delete button to two of the pages and ensure it redirected to the correct page once an item was deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was fairly straight-forward, though it did take some time as I was still in the process of learning the set-up of their project. Since the delete button existed elsewhere in the application, I could copy and paste the code into my cshtml file and make a few minor adjustments. Redirecting the page was handled by a javascript file. I made a new function, which was basically a copy of an already existing function, but tweaked the code so it would redirect to a particular overview page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the application in debug mode (in Visual Studio, the F5 key). Everything worked. I was excited that I may be nearly done my task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I ran the code normally (Ctrl + F5), not in debug mode.  And it didn’t work - the page contents would not appear, and none of the buttons worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t understand why this would happen.  I searched for answers online. Stack overflow suggested that it in normal mode, certain variables aren’t being initialized, but in debug mode variables default to zero. I scanned my code to see where there could be uninitialized variables but couldn’t find anything helpful.  I got onto discord and asked my web developer friends, who suggested the delete button was not properly connected to the necessary function in the javascript file. Once again I scanned my code, but there were no typos, everything was connected properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was becoming very frustrated, feeling like I was missing something important. That I just didn’t understand some important feature of .NET, and that this was going to take ages to dig into and fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried testing it again. In Visual Studio I did a clean and build. In the browser I did a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised and a little suspicious. I didn’t think it would be that easy, but it was.  Previously, the old javascript file was saved in the cache, not my new updated one. Once it had the new file it worked like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all of that to say, I learned the importance of trying the simple solutions first. Restart Visual Studio. Restart your computer.  And if working with javascript, just try a hard refresh.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/dotnet-errors-and-solutions">&lt;p&gt;Here are a few errors I received while working on a .NET application, and how I solved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unable-to-determine-composite-primary-key-ordering-for-type-use-the-columnattribute-or-the-haskey-method&quot;&gt;“Unable to determine composite primary key ordering for type… Use the ColumnAttribute or the HasKey method…”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This occured because I tried to assign more than one [Key] in a C# class file, as per below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;whatever&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;anotherOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microsoft docs actually helped me here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/data-annotations?redirectedfrom=MSDN#composite-keys&quot;&gt;Microsoft docs on data annotation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you have more than one primary key, you need to give them an order using the column attribute, like below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Column(Order=1)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;whatever&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Column(Order=2)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;anotherOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the order doesn’t have to start at zero like an index, the order is just relative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-operation-requires-a-connection-to-master-database&quot;&gt;“This operation requires a connection to master database”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an issue connecting to my database, and this was fixed by adding “Integrated Security=True;” to the connection string in my Web.config file.  This is what stack overflow suggested you do when you’re connecting to the database with Windows Authentication, rather than a separate username and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cannot-insert-null-value-into-column-id&quot;&gt;“Cannot insert null value into column id”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application uses a database of students. If you create a new student in the application it should add to the students table in the database. The problem was the student id number wasn’t being assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Stack Overflow. Assuming you want the id to automatically increment, this is what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SQL Server Management Studio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open table in Design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;select your column, go to Column Properties&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check Identity Specification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set “IsIdentity” to “yes”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set “IdentityIncrement” to “1”, so it increments by 1 each time you add a new student&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>
