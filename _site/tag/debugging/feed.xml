      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-3">&lt;p&gt;I made my changes to CSS without any more problems and I cleaned up my markdown files, as I mentioned last time. I figured now would be as good a time as any to deploy. I can keep adding posts and making small adjustments once deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there have been errors with this as well. As expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my github repo and pushed my code using command line. I used the following commands and this worked without errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git init&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git add .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git commit -m “first commit”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git remote add origin https://github.com/jchack1/julia-blog2.git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git push -u origin master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to deploy with Netlify, which is my go to for any deployment. It’s usually pretty straightforward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/&quot;&gt;and you can find the instructions for deploying Jekyll with Netlify here.&lt;/a&gt;  I selected my github repo and clicked deploy. After a few minutes I got an error, saying the build failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is because Netlify was looking for the _site folder.  I checked my files and I saw that I did not have this.  By now I’m getting pretty frustrated with this theme because it feels like there was a lot missing and unexplained. Why isn’t there a _site folder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; looking for any information about the _site folder.  I saw that when you use the command “jekyll build”, Jekyll builds the site and outputs it to a directory called _site, which is viewable in the browser at localhost:4000. I have used the “jekyll build” command many times so far, so I was unsure why it’s not in my files.  And why I was able to serve my site to localhost:4000.  I decided to see what would happen if I make a new Jekyll folder from scratch and run “jekyll build”. In my previous sites I always had a _site folder and never gave any thought to how it was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I decided to just follow my old notes rather than just copy-paste from my theme. I went into the Jekyll folder I already have on my machine and opened command line. I used the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jekyll new julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cd julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bundle exec jekyll build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the files in the folders and there it was. Once I used the jekyll build command, my _site folder appeared. Perhaps this was my mistake from the beginning. I never intiallized my folder properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to check both folders now, to see if I could either update my blog scripts to create the _site file, or if I’d need to copy everything over into my new folder. Whatever I tried in my old folder did not work, so I ended up copying everything over into my new folder. I set up gulp, which was really quick this time since I knew what I was doing. When I executed “bundle exec jekyll build” I now ended up with a _site folder, and it was filled with the proper files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will upload this new folder to github and deploy. It should work now that I have a proper _site folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have to remember to always “bundle exec jekyll build” and “bundle exec jekyll serve”(to generate files in _site folder) when I make changes. But only after I execute “gulp”. Hopefully I will quickly get used to this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New jekyll site part 2 - errors with Gulp" />

      <updated>2020-04-04T17:31:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-2</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-2">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from my last post, where I began to describe the process of making this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m at the point of self-isolation where I’m starting to forget what day it is.  I believe I spent the past 3 days or so trying to figure out this problem, though at this point I’ve lost track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left off describing my issue of CSS not compiling the way I expected it to.  I admit I should have checked the instructions on the Jasper2 theme’s github in the very beginning so I would be aware that they use gulp. I followed the instructions to install gulp, but it still didn’t work. I spent many more hours fiddling around with it, then I decided to look up a tutorial on gulp in case my issue was simply not knowing enough about gulp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw that gulp utilizes command line.  You can create functions in your gulpfile.js that can be executed in the command line; in my case, the gulpfile was already created. Below is an example function that was included with my theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'build'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* cb */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodemonServerInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is a gulp task, named build.  To run this code I would type “gulp build” in the command line. If you name a task “default”, all you need to type in command line is “gulp”, and your default task is run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I learned this I was getting much closer to figuring out my problem.  However when I ran “gulp” or “gulp build”, I got an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;fs.js:27
const { Math, Object } = primordials;
                         ^

ReferenceError: primordials is not defined&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched online for a solution to this error as kind of a last ditch effort. Up until this point, I could not find any solutions at all, and there were no issues of this kind brought up by users on Jasper2’s github page.  Of course, stack overflow gave me a solution, which I would never have thought of myself unless I looked it up. I believe it was the second answer on this page that helped me: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55921442/how-to-fix-referenceerror-primordials-is-not-defined-in-node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that the node.js and gulp versions were incompatible. Remember my last post, where I wondered if I had an issue with my package versions? In a way I was right, just not in the way I expected. Node version 11.5 and higher, and gulp 3.9.1 are not compatible. This version of gulp depends on graceful-fs version 3.0.0, which is something I’m still unfamiliar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this I had to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add the below code to my package.json, and run “npm install” in command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;preinstall&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;npx npm-force-resolutions&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;resolutions&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;graceful-fs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;4.2.3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this just to be able to tweak the CSS in my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I make a change to CSS, I execute the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gulp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I really want to be thorough, I will add in “bundle exec jekyll build” before I serve the site)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there is a way to make gulp watch for changes, but I haven’t figured out how to make that work with jekyll. For now though this works just fine, despite the extra typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Now I think it’s time to finally make my changes to CSS, as well as research markdown in order to clean up my blog posts.  See you in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">The importance of a hard refresh</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/importance-of-hard-refresh" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The importance of a hard refresh" />
      <published>2020-04-02T12:12:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-04-02T12:12:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/importance-of-hard-refresh</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/importance-of-hard-refresh">&lt;p&gt;Recently I was working on a task for my practicum.  The task was to add a delete button to two of the pages and ensure it redirected to the correct page once an item was deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was fairly straight-forward, though it did take some time as I was still in the process of learning the set-up of their project. Since the delete button existed elsewhere in the application, I could copy and paste the code into my cshtml file and make a few minor adjustments. Redirecting the page was handled by a javascript file. I made a new function, which was basically a copy of an already existing function, but tweaked the code so it would redirect to a particular overview page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the application in debug mode (in Visual Studio, the F5 key). Everything worked. I was excited that I may be nearly done my task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I ran the code normally (Ctrl + F5), not in debug mode.  And it didn’t work - the page contents would not appear, and none of the buttons worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t understand why this would happen.  I searched for answers online. Stack overflow suggested that it in normal mode, certain variables aren’t being initialized, but in debug mode variables default to zero. I scanned my code to see where there could be uninitialized variables but couldn’t find anything helpful.  I got onto discord and asked my web developer friends, who suggested the delete button was not properly connected to the necessary function in the javascript file. Once again I scanned my code, but there were no typos, everything was connected properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was becoming very frustrated, feeling like I was missing something important. That I just didn’t understand some important feature of .NET, and that this was going to take ages to dig into and fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried testing it again. In Visual Studio I did a clean and build. In the browser I did a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised and a little suspicious. I didn’t think it would be that easy, but it was.  Previously, the old javascript file was saved in the cache, not my new updated one. Once it had the new file it worked like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all of that to say, I learned the importance of trying the simple solutions first. Restart Visual Studio. Restart your computer.  And if working with javascript, just try a hard refresh.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/dotnet-errors-and-solutions">&lt;p&gt;Here are a few errors I received while working on a .NET application, and how I solved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unable-to-determine-composite-primary-key-ordering-for-type-use-the-columnattribute-or-the-haskey-method&quot;&gt;“Unable to determine composite primary key ordering for type… Use the ColumnAttribute or the HasKey method…”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This occured because I tried to assign more than one [Key] in a C# class file, as per below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;whatever&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;anotherOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microsoft docs actually helped me here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/data-annotations?redirectedfrom=MSDN#composite-keys&quot;&gt;Microsoft docs on data annotation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you have more than one primary key, you need to give them an order using the column attribute, like below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Column(Order=1)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;whatever&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Key]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Column(Order=2)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;anotherOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the order doesn’t have to start at zero like an index, the order is just relative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-operation-requires-a-connection-to-master-database&quot;&gt;“This operation requires a connection to master database”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an issue connecting to my database, and this was fixed by adding “Integrated Security=True;” to the connection string in my Web.config file.  This is what stack overflow suggested you do when you’re connecting to the database with Windows Authentication, rather than a separate username and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cannot-insert-null-value-into-column-id&quot;&gt;“Cannot insert null value into column id”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application uses a database of students. If you create a new student in the application it should add to the students table in the database. The problem was the student id number wasn’t being assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Stack Overflow. Assuming you want the id to automatically increment, this is what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SQL Server Management Studio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open table in Design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;select your column, go to Column Properties&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check Identity Specification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set “IsIdentity” to “yes”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set “IdentityIncrement” to “1”, so it increments by 1 each time you add a new student&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>
