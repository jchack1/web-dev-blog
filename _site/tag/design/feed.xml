      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/pdfs-and-ats">&lt;p&gt;We’re stepping away from the world of programming for a moment to talk about a design-related topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently been working on my resume and have been learning a lot of new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I was in school I took a career class, with a few days dedicated to resumes. They showed us all the latest trends in resume designs, and I thought I came up with something fairly eye-catching. If I’m honest, it was just a template from Canva that I adjusted a bit, so it wasn’t my original design, but I found the software very easy to work with. I liked the drag-and-drop functionality and the end result. It produced a nice PDF with a two-column layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting my next two jobs through my school or people I knew, so this resume worked fine. I have been updating the same resume with new skills and work experience ever since, up until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to bring this up with a friend that had her resume reviewed by the career services at her university, so I asked her to have a look at mine. One of her main criticisms was the two column layout. If I were to use it to apply to jobs online, applicant tracking systems may not be able to read it, because these systems read documents left to right. I looked into this a little more and this seems to be the consensus about two-column layouts, although it’s possible some systems are sophisticated enough to read them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming most systems aren’t at that level of sophistication, though, it means the text from the left and right column will be jumbled together. Of course the systems wouldn’t be able to parse this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-attempt-at-fixing-it---creating-a-one-column-layout&quot;&gt;First attempt at fixing it - creating a one-column layout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Canva again to make a one-column resume. I ran it through a resume checker to see if it scored well, and it did not. It couldn’t find important sections of my resume that I had included. I was very confused as to why, since now it should be in a more readable format, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-attempt---creating-the-template-myself-in-illustrator&quot;&gt;Second attempt - creating the template myself in Illustrator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe Canva was doing something weird with the formatting, so I decided to create a new resume from scratch using Adobe Illustrator, creating every element from scratch myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the new document through the resume checker, and found a similar result. Some parts of my resume were coming through as expected, like my contact information, but some sections were still missing. I googled the problem, and some of the solutions mentioned the order the elements are created in the document can cause things to appear out of order, and to check what happens when you copy the text from the PDF into Notepad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I copied the text into Notepad, it was a mess. Everything was completely out of order, even though it appeared normal in the PDF. Text didn’t properly follow the headings, which is why the resume checker couldn’t locate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;third-attempt---re-ordering-the-elements-before-export&quot;&gt;Third attempt - re-ordering the elements before export&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I chose to fix this was by going into the layers panel in Illustrator and manually putting the elements in the correct order. I could see that the order they were in before this fix matched the way they showed up in Notepad, so this would likely fix my problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exporting the new document, I pasted the text into Notepad again, and this time the order was correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not being a programming problem, this issue felt a lot like the normal debugging I do day-to-day. I find it so frustrating that these problems you cannot easily see could completely throw off someone’s job search, and they may not even realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of advice given about resumes, and it seems to change constantly. This is a whole separate skill set than a developer skillset. It would be easy to feel like these automated rejections are rejecting your developer skillset and experience, or even you as a person. But it’s truly not that personal. The entities reading this curated summary of your work life aren’t even human. All I can say is keep learning new skills and trying your best.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">Helpful design notes - fonts</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/design-fonts" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Helpful design notes - fonts" />
      <published>2021-03-02T15:30:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2021-03-02T15:30:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/design-fonts</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/design-fonts">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since we had a new post on design so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m back working on my UX Design / Adobe XD course so I thought I’d make some notes here with some helpful tips. Today is mostly about fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fonts.google.com&lt;/strong&gt; - free fonts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fonts.adobe.com&lt;/strong&gt; - paid fonts, should be included in creative cloud subscription&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Adobe fonts, can click “activate font” and use it in Adobe XD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Google fonts, to use in your design software, you need to download the font and install on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choosing-fonts&quot;&gt;Choosing fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decorative fonts are good for headers, but not great for body text. If you make your text more narrow, you can fit more characters in your titles. It doesn’t look as good if your titles break onto multiple lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fonts can slow down website loading. Your browser has to go find the font and download it for use on your site. If you have many fonts with many different weights it takes longer for your site to load. Decreasing the number of fonts and weights you include in your site can help with loading time and also with SEO - Google finds these sites to be more friendly. Google fonts will let you know if your load time is fast, moderate, slow, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search for font combinations if you are unsure what fonts you should pair together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-font-sizes-for-your-designs&quot;&gt;Common font sizes for your designs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heading 1 - 40&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heading 2 - 32&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heading 3 - 24&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body copy - 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These work well with your baseline grid in XD, if it is also divisible by 8. Items line up nicely with your grid this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In XD, add your fonts into Character Styles so you have your fonts quickly available for you and your team throughout the design process. This is helpful if you need to change your font - XD will find all instances of this font being used and update it when you change the font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While doing a bit of my own research in this area I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html&quot;&gt;this article on learnui.design&lt;/a&gt;.
Their recommendation was to start with a font size of 16px and go from there, depending on your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your site is text heavy, a larger font is more desirable, as it is easier to read and helps the user avoid eye strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the site is interaction heavy, an app like Facebook maybe, then you wouldn’t want to go higher than 16px. Users are more likely to be scanning the page than reading closely, so larger text doesn’t feel quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, they recommended to not have more than 4 font sizes. This looks a little different than what’s shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A header size - add another smaller size if you need a sub-heading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your default size - 16px&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secondary size - a couple points smaller than your default, eg. 14px, for less important details and captions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tertiary size - in case you need another smaller size, not always necessary though, again things like labels and captions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buttons&quot;&gt;Buttons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at design systems like Google Material can help you get inspiration to make better buttons. They add things like rounded corners, drop shadow, etc, to make buttons look more clickable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add icons like arrows, plus, chevrons - to show convey that the button performs some actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colours are important for buttons to convey the correct meaning. Important buttons, like delete, could be red. Be consistent with your colours across your site so users don’t get confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good site to visit to learn more about UX/UI concepts is &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxplanet.org/&quot;&gt;UXPlanet.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uxplanet.org/primary-secondary-action-buttons-c16df9b36150&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; has some good tips for creating primary and secondary buttons, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;making buttons distinct&lt;/strong&gt; - could use a brighter colour for the primary button, for example. But be careful about buttons that cause a negative action, like delete buttons. Make these less obvious than the accompanying “cancel” button. You don’t want users to take a permanent action by mistake because they just clicked on the most obvious button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;button labels should explain what they do&lt;/strong&gt; - describe the action with a verb, for example use “submit” instead of “ok”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">Usability - notes from design course</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/usability" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Usability - notes from design course" />
      <published>2020-09-07T14:30:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-09-07T14:30:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/usability</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/usability">&lt;p&gt;I am back working on my Udemy course, “Master Digital Product Design: UX Research and UI Design”. In this post I will add some notes on usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability Heuristics, I have learned, is a way of saying “rule of thumb”. So these are not usability rules exactly; they are usability suggestions and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While going through these lectures I have been cringing a bit. Recently I realized I am becoming more interested in and passionate about good user experience and easing frustration for the user. The designer in me knows how important these points are. However, I know I have broken some of these best practices as a developer. It has been difficult for me to implement my features in the best possible way when task requirements are unclear, on large systems I did not create myself. I came across roadblocks and had to get around them somehow, and then I was irritated with myself for not implementing the feature in the “best” way. But in those sitations, I did what I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I’m still enjoying learning about UX and UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;useful-links&quot;&gt;Useful links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui-patterns.com/patterns&quot;&gt;UI-patterns.com&lt;/a&gt; has in-depth descriptions and examples of many design patterns you see in user interface design, including cards, modals, dropdown menus, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://contrastchecker.com/&quot;&gt;contrast checker&lt;/a&gt; site allows you to check the foreground and background colors on your site against various conditions, to make sure the level of contrast is acceptable. You could use this while auditing your sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-heuristics&quot;&gt;Usability Heuristics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visibility: &lt;/strong&gt; (of system status) includes the idea of instant feedback - does a button instantly change when clicked? Is there a loading bar/spinner when a file is downloading?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System and real world matching: &lt;/strong&gt; does the language used sound like how we speak in real life? Or in the industry the software is used in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User control and freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; can the user easily escape their previous action? Nothing we build is fully intuitive and the user will make mistakes. Can you reset, undo, go back? This allows users to explore and experiment, since they won’t be afraid of clicking and making irreversible mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency and standards: &lt;/strong&gt; does it use existing conventions and standards used on other sites? Does it follow design patterns we typically see on websites? Some examples are hamburger icons for menus, paper clip icons for attachments, and shopping cart icons on e-commerce sites. Sites can also create their own standards - for example, Google uses different colored buttons for different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error prevention: &lt;/strong&gt; warn users if they are going to perform a significant action, like clearing a form. Or prevent an action altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition rather than recall: &lt;/strong&gt; storing important information on the screen rather than making the user remember. For example, highlighting what page they’re on or category they are in so they don’t have to remember where they are in the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility and efficiency of use: &lt;/strong&gt; making the software easier to use for advanced users, so they can quickly finish routine tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetics and minimalism: &lt;/strong&gt; you want the minimal amount of things on the screen, so we don’t overload the user’s working memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: &lt;/strong&gt; do we tell users about the errors clearly, and can they easily find the solutions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help and documentation: &lt;/strong&gt; is there help available and can users find where it is? Are the steps clear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-audits&quot;&gt;Usability audits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are different from usability heuristics. Heuristics are vague, but an audit is more of a checklist. These are rules you come up with as part of your design process. Creating the audit can be time-consuming, but filling it out should be relatively quick and simple. Audits should contain specific yes or no questions that anyone can fill in while reviewing the product. No opinions should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example questions on the checklist (from a real checklist shown in the course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does every display begin with a title or header that describes screen contents?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there visual feeback in menus or dialog boxes about which choice the cursor is on now?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the current status of an icon clearly indicated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often recommended that testing be done often, and that everyone in your company should observe users using the software regularly. Programmers, managers, everyone else; everyone involved with the product should observe the software being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t just ask users what they like. They will start to post-rationalize reasons why they like or dislike it, and start coming up with their own solutions. They will think about what would be useful in a hypothetical situation. But that’s not actually very useful for us. It’s important to &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; them using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;usability test&lt;/strong&gt; is when you give a user a task and observe what they do. You look for responses in their faces, and you need to be impartial and not influence the user’s behavior. Get users to talk out their thought process while using the product - that way you don’t have to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons to do usability testing with experienced users as well as new users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;experienced users may not even be experts in the software; users often fiddle their way through until they complete what they need to do, without mastering the product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;products tested with only first time users can sometimes be set up really well to guide users through set up and early stages, but tasks they attempt later on may be very frustrating because they haven’t been given as much attention&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;existing customers are very valuable, more so than new customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test as early as you can! Don’t wait until you have a finished design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click testing: &lt;/strong&gt; a quantitative method for testing, where users are given a task and you can see where they click in your design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can test a large number of people and get data about how they are navigating your product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;however, you just don’t know how they were feeling while they were going the test, so it is hard to gauge the reason they clicked where they did, and how big of a problem it is when a user does something “incorrectly”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a site you can use for this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://usabilityhub.com/&quot;&gt;usabilityhub.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ux-3">&lt;p&gt;Optimal Sort: helps you with information architecture, card sorting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;test how people think content should be organized&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;test with lots of people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can do this manually with paper cards and in person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/&quot;&gt;Optimal sort found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:1 worksheet for wireframing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;draw four different ideas for how a page might work, then take the one you like the best (for whatever reason) and draw it in one box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can do this for each section of your website that you got from your information architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireframes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balsamiq is a good tool, partly because of the hand-drawn look
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hand drawn looks unfinished, so people will not get too attached and think it’s the final product&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;looking good and having an aesthetic draws people to it. Aestheics are important. If it doesn’t look good, people won’t like it and they won’t use it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perception&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to improve perception skills, think of something that you firmly believe is correct, and think of an argument for why it is incorrect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;logic is the enemy of perception, it tells us we already know the answer; perception makes us go out and look for more answers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we perceive a small amount of the world around us - our brain is interpreting what we see&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t want to assume the user is seeing everything on the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can design applications for a focused or diffused state of thinking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google is for a focused state; it is minimal, not a lot of distractions, has pagination&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YouTube is for a diffused state, when you are looking to browse and be distracted; lots to grab you attention, infinite scroll, lots of ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iconic memory: in our eye, fast and short, picks up patterns, light, colors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filters: only see what we are looking for, decides whether we should pay attention to it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working memory: can only hold a few things at once, finite, only add to it if it’s really important because we need to take something else out to add it in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long term memory: for a lifetime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual encoding channels: things that make items stand out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;position, color, size, shape, texture, gradient, angle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;color: hue, brightness differences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;position most important - why we make wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;determining how important something is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;headings big, meta-information small&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can only pay attention to one thing at once&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t make everything on the page the most important thing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assign items on a page with a hierarchy score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructor reiterated that this is about coming up with the process that works best for you and not to copy another designer’s style. Make changes however you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four main steps in most processes: research (empathize), analyze (your reserach), ideate (generate ideas), test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistakes people make/things people don’t realize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is a design process; need to do research, come up with ideas, etc. One can’t just come up with an idea on the spot, work needs to go into it, and that takes the form of your design process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;need to have an excess of research before you analyze, and need excess of ideas before you test them; it’s imporant to be aware of as many problems that you are facing as possible, so you can proritize the most imporant ones. Solving some problems can also cause problems in other areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;each of these design phases require different types of thinking; &lt;strong&gt;divergence and convergence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research and ideation are divergent, quantity over quantity, need to gather lots of data
Analysis and testing are convergent, need to focus on most important details, lots of time to think&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-thinkingdesign-thinking&quot;&gt;Critical thinking/design thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scandinavian cooperative design: Scandinavian designers actually worked with the people they were building software for. The workers essentially helped to design the software they were going to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this type of process is more about perception, rather than a “scientific” or rational thinking kind of process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;often re-packaged as “design thinking”, boiled down to process steps; these short courses don’t usually help you to become a better designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation theatre: the appearance of being innovative without actually having interest in a better user experience; more for show, for stakeholders, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is about &lt;strong&gt;thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it’s important to improve your preception, creativity skills, and listen more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decisions come from emotions rather than rational thinking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;book recommendation was Six Thinking Hats - to learn about different ways of thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experience&quot;&gt;Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can get people to buy products by saving them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the cost of any of these is too high it is no longer worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, improving the experience of a product is more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to look at the emotional responses that people have to various tasks in their lives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;e.g. Tinder - online dating full of rejection and emotional pain, Tinder takes the rejection out of it by having “matches” and includes the experience of “swiping” people out of your life or into your life
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;good experience, however not in the long term&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on making something a good experience does not make it inherently good. A cheeseburger is a good experience, but is not good &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://humanetech.com/&quot;&gt;Center for Humane Technology&lt;/a&gt;: organization that wants to make things that are good for people, rather than focusing on a good experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to talk about things that are easy to articulate. But sometimes it’s more important to address the things that are difficult to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perception&lt;/strong&gt; is important. If someone says it took too long to do something on your site, it’s likely they just don’t like your site. It doesn’t matter how long it actually took them - if they perceived it to take too long it is a problem. People’s experiences are not rooted in reality. These things can be difficult to articulate to your coworkers; talking about things like the number of clicks to a particular part of a site is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to feel in control. They like to know how long it will be until the Uber or train arrives, and will more happily wait when they know what to expect. If your site responds when you click a button, or you let the user know that something is loading, they will be more patient with your site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software design isn’t all about usability - creativity is important too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;e.g. TV remote - if you take away some buttons from your TV remote, you should replace them with something unique and interesting. If you just take buttons away, people will think it’s less valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creativity&quot;&gt;Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR - creative people come up with lots and lots of ideas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value novel experiences, even if the things we have are fine as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity: ability to generate novel solutions to a problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how many ideas you can come up with in a defined amount of time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;judgement free, whatever comes to you; don’t try to overthink and figure out why something won’t work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t be creative and rationalize at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this is important to practice - the more you do it the better you get&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your first idea is probably bad, and don’t want to get attached to an idea too early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; every day pick a problem and see how many solutions you can come up with in one minute&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise: think of 100 uses for a potato, see how quickly you can do it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can do this for other things like a pin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin: sometimes unique traits help an animal survive, more than fitness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so don’t make your designs forgettable - you need some uniqueness for people to remember it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things we love are imperfect and unique. Humans’ highest perception of value is creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to write down or draw out your ideas. It gets them out of your working memory, freeing it up for the more interesting ideas underneath. Use paper and get away from the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good ideas are hidden under bad ideas”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important parts of your brain for creativity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Central Executive Network - for focusing on a task&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Default Mode Network - where you daydream and let your brain make new connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most creative people use both of these parts of the brain at once or can switch between them quickly. Taking breaks is good, because that’s when you’re in default mode. A lot of ideas can come when you’re not in focused mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boundaries/limits make people more creative - Van Gogh used only a few colors in his paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rory’s story cubes: roll them, come up with a story&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-its:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not too much detail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gets people moving around the room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can combine your ideas easily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gets thrown away; ideas on their own aren’t valuable, don’t get attached to ideas too early&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;downside: innovation theatre; just because you have post-it notes doesn’t mean you are innovating, have to use them properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test ideas way before you’re ready&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;e.g. comedians testing out their jokes; cross out the bad jokes that don’t get many laughs
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;they create more jokes than most people, and they test them, not necessarily more funny than anyone else&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

      <published>2020-07-01T12:30:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-07-01T12:30:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/starting-ux-course</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/starting-ux-course">&lt;p&gt;I really love design. It was an area I did well in during school and my instructor commented on this a few times. I want to improve my skills and build a portfolio in case this is an area I want to pursue in the future, so I started a design course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is Master Digital Product Design: UX Research and UI Design.  I’m already a few minutes in and the instructor is telling us to not take anything said as concrete advice. So, I’ll write some notes while I’m going through the course while keeping this idea in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;go onto sites like Dribble and recreate the designs in different styles to improve creativity, perception, and increase your awareness of what’s out there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t just copy design processes from blog posts and other companies; learn the reasoning why they use these methods and take inspiration from them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your perpective gives you something new as a designer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a designer is a person that solves problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;most innovations and new inventions have come about because of emotions rather than utility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a designer is a planner/strategizer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a design is like an important plan where we don’t want to use existing solutions - have to spend time and do research to innovate and create the new thing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is no solid definition for UX design/designer - it’s important to look at job requirements and ask your boss so it’s clear what YOU are going to be doing, and you want to make sure your team is clear on your role as well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are no rules in design, just guidelines to help you go in the correct direction; you don’t HAVE to do anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atomic design process: start with the smallest parts of a page rather than designing the whole page first. Decide on fonts, design buttons and reusable components, and your pages will come together more easily later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacob’s law: basically make your site like other sites, since people already know how to use those&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrogant design: when someone tries to create something new without fully understanding the product and the industry. These designers believe their experience is more important than the experiences and perspectives of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fold: from newspapers, when you put the important information at the top ie. “above the fold” and less important info “below the fold”. Used in websites early on but found to be useless since people can easily scroll down the page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple good resources (just beware that they are marketing their own products and may be biased):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invisionapp.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99u.adobe.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jnd.org (Don Norman, has good books on product design)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at articles on other types of design, like architecture or print media, since they are coming up with lots of new solutions to problems all the time. This will bring insights to product design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’re looking at designs visually - not every concept can be articulated in words. Resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;designspriation.com - all kinds of design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dribbble.com - mostly UI design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;abduzeedo.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-briefs&quot;&gt;Design briefs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructor started to mention design briefs and reaching out to local companies and asking for them. I have not yet done this, but I decided to do a quick search on google and see if there are any good examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this site: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.briefbox.me/&quot;&gt;briefbox.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like they have courses and briefs/challenges for students. This looks pretty useful so I’m going to have a look at some of these when I have time for practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a note to self, I can create case studies for some of the projects I have already created, or web dev projects I plan to start soon. Assuming I remember my process for creating them, which I most likely do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is a design complete? When it meets the pre-defined requirements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you get good at writing very detailed briefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important components of a design brief:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;final approver/stakeholders: make sure these are solid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;main contact: whoever is the person to contact with additional questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;about the client: ask lots of questions to understand their company, culture, whether they already have a process in place that they’d like this project to follow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;project goals: how do we know when the project is complete? How will you measure if the project is successful. Make sure they are describing problems that YOU can solve for them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;target audience: get lots of detail, need to test designs on later, need to research them and what they value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deliverables: what you are providing to company. e.g. what files would they accept if you are providing them icons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scheduled sessions: with stakeholders, final approver, other contacts, to make sure you’re on the right track - meeting to present research, another to present wireframes, another to present design. good to schedule in revision sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;branding keywords: so you can understand brand’s values and personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure they sign off on it, so there’s no going back and you know what your job is.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
