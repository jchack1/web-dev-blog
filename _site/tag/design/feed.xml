      <id>http://localhost:4000/usability</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/usability">&lt;p&gt;I am back working on my Udemy course, “Master Digital Product Design: UX Research and UI Design”. In this post I will add some notes on usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability Heuristics, I have learned, is a way of saying “rule of thumb”.  So these are not usability rules exactly; they are usability suggestions and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While going through these lectures I have been cringing a bit. Recently I realized I am becoming more interested in and passionate about good user experience and easing frustration for the user. The designer in me knows how important these points are. However, I know I have broken some of these best practices as a developer.  It has been difficult for me to implement my features in the best possible way when task requirements are unclear, on large systems I did not create myself. I came across roadblocks and had to get around them somehow, and then I was irritated with myself for not implementing the feature in the “best” way. But in those sitations, I did what I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I’m still enjoying learning about UX and UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;useful-links&quot;&gt;Useful links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site &lt;a href=&quot;http://ui-patterns.com/patterns&quot;&gt;UI-patterns.com&lt;/a&gt; has in-depth descriptions and examples of many design patterns you see in user interface design, including cards, modals, dropdown menus, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://contrastchecker.com/&quot;&gt;contrast checker&lt;/a&gt; site allows you to check the foreground and background colors on your site against various conditions, to make sure the level of contrast is acceptable. You could use this while auditing your sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-heuristics&quot;&gt;Usability Heuristics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visibility: &lt;/strong&gt; (of system status) includes the idea of instant feedback - does a button instantly change when clicked? Is there a loading bar/spinner when a file is downloading?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System and real world matching: &lt;/strong&gt; does the language used sound like how we speak in real life? Or in the industry the software is used in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User control and freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; can the user easily escape their previous action? Nothing we build is fully intuitive and the user will make mistakes. Can you reset, undo, go back? This allows users to explore and experiment, since they won’t be afraid of clicking and making irreversible mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency and standards: &lt;/strong&gt; does it use existing conventions and standards used on other sites? Does it follow design patterns we typically see on websites? Some examples are hamburger icons for menus, paper clip icons for attachments, and shopping cart icons on e-commerce sites. Sites can also create their own standards - for example, Google uses different colored buttons for different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error prevention: &lt;/strong&gt; warn users if they are going to perform a significant action, like clearing a form. Or prevent an action altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition rather than recall: &lt;/strong&gt; storing important information on the screen rather than making the user remember. For example, highlighting what page they’re on or category they are in so they don’t have to remember where they are in the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility and efficiency of use: &lt;/strong&gt; making the software easier to use for advanced users, so they can quickly finish routine tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetics and minimalism: &lt;/strong&gt; you want the minimal amount of things on the screen, so we don’t overload the user’s working memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: &lt;/strong&gt; do we tell users about the errors clearly, and can they easily find the solutions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help and documentation: &lt;/strong&gt; is there help available and can users find where it is? Are the steps clear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-audits&quot;&gt;Usability audits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are different from usability heuristics. Heuristics are vague, but an audit is more of a checklist. These are rules you come up with as part of your design process. Creating the audit can be time-consuming, but filling it out should be relatively quick and simple. Audits should contain specific yes or no questions that anyone can fill in while reviewing the product. No opinions should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example questions on the checklist (from a real checklist shown in the course):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does every display begin with a title or header that describes screen contents?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there visual feeback in menus or dialog boxes about which choice the cursor is on now?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the current status of an icon clearly indicated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often recommended that testing be done often, and that everyone in your company should observe users using the software regularly. Programmers, managers, everyone else; everyone involved with the product should observe the software being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t just ask users what they like. They will start to post-rationalize reasons why they like or dislike it, and start coming up with their own solutions. They will think about what would be useful in a hypothetical situation. But that’s not actually very useful for us. It’s important to &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; them using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;usability test&lt;/strong&gt; is when you give a user a task and observe what they do. You look for responses in their faces, and you need to be impartial and not influence the user’s behavior. Get users to talk out their thought process while using the product - that way you don’t have to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons to do usability testing with experienced users as well as new users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;experienced users may not even be experts in the software; users often fiddle their way through until they complete what they need to do, without mastering the product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;products tested with only first time users can sometimes be set up really well to guide users through set up and early stages, but tasks they attempt later on may be very frustrating because they haven’t been given as much attention&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;existing customers are very valuable, more so than new customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test as early as you can! Don’t wait until you have a finished design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click testing: &lt;/strong&gt; a quantitative method for testing, where users are given a task and you can see where they click in your design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can test a large number of people and get data about how they are navigating your product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;however, you just don’t know how they were feeling while they were going the test, so it is hard to gauge the reason they clicked where they did, and how big of a problem it is when a user does something “incorrectly”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a site you can use for this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://usabilityhub.com/&quot;&gt;usabilityhub.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <published>2020-07-01T12:30:00-06:00</published>
      <updated>2020-07-01T12:30:00-06:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/starting-ux-course</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/starting-ux-course">&lt;p&gt;I really love design. It was an area I did well in during school and my instructor commented on this a few times. I want to improve my skills and build a portfolio in case this is an area I want to pursue in the future, so I started a design course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is Master Digital Product Design: UX Research and UI Design.  I’m already a few minutes in and the instructor is telling us to not take anything said as concrete advice. So, I’ll write some notes while I’m going through the course while keeping this idea in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;go onto sites like Dribble and recreate the designs in different styles to improve creativity, perception, and increase your awareness of what’s out there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t just copy design processes from blog posts and other companies; learn the reasoning why they use these methods and take inspiration from them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your perpective gives you something new as a designer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a designer is a person that solves problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;most innovations and new inventions have come about because of emotions rather than utility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a designer is a planner/strategizer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a design is like an important plan where we don’t want to use existing solutions - have to spend time and do research to innovate and create the new thing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is no solid definition for UX design/designer - it’s important to look at job requirements and ask your boss so it’s clear what YOU are going to be doing, and you want to make sure your team is clear on your role as well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are no rules in design, just guidelines to help you go in the correct direction; you don’t HAVE to do anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atomic design process: start with the smallest parts of a page rather than designing the whole page first. Decide on fonts, design buttons and reusable components, and your pages will come together more easily later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacob’s law: basically make your site like other sites, since people already know how to use those&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrogant design: when someone tries to create something new without fully understanding the product and the industry. These designers believe their experience is more important than the experiences and perspectives of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fold: from newspapers, when you put the important information at the top ie. “above the fold” and less important info “below the fold”. Used in websites early on but found to be useless since people can easily scroll down the page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple good resources (just beware that they are marketing their own products and may be biased):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invisionapp.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99u.adobe.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jnd.org (Don Norman, has good books on product design)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at articles on other types of design, like architecture or print media, since they are coming up with lots of new solutions to problems all the time. This will bring insights to product design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you’re looking at designs visually - not every concept can be articulated in words. Resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;designspriation.com - all kinds of design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dribbble.com - mostly UI design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;abduzeedo.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-briefs&quot;&gt;Design briefs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructor started to mention design briefs and reaching out to local companies and asking for them. I have not yet done this, but I decided to do a quick search on google and see if there are any good examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this site: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.briefbox.me/&quot;&gt;briefbox.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like they have courses and briefs/challenges for students. This looks pretty useful so I’m going to have a look at some of these when I have time for practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a note to self, I can create case studies for some of the projects I have already created, or web dev projects I plan to start soon. Assuming I remember my process for creating them, which I most likely do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is a design complete? When it meets the pre-defined requirements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you get good at writing very detailed briefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important components of a design brief:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;final approver/stakeholders: make sure these are solid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;main contact: whoever is the person to contact with additional questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;about the client: ask lots of questions to understand their company, culture, whether they already have a process in place that they’d like this project to follow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;project goals: how do we know when the project is complete? How will you measure if the project is successful. Make sure they are describing problems that YOU can solve for them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;target audience: get lots of detail, need to test designs on later, need to research them and what they value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deliverables: what you are providing to company. e.g. what files would they accept if you are providing them icons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scheduled sessions: with stakeholders, final approver, other contacts, to make sure you’re on the right track - meeting to present research, another to present wireframes, another to present design. good to schedule in revision sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;branding keywords: so you can understand brand’s values and personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure they sign off on it, so there’s no going back and you know what your job is.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
