      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mern-deploy-render">&lt;p&gt;Due to the recent changes with Heroku removing its free tier, I decided to move a few of my portfolio apps over to Render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I understand that companies want to make money, I can’t justify spending money, even a small amount, every month just to host demo portfolio apps that probably no one looks at except me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a tutorial. I just wanted to mention a few things I ran into while deploying my apps that could help someone (or me) in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across Render when looking for a platform to deploy Node.js/Express/MongoDB apps. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-nodejs-application-with-render/&quot;&gt;freeCodeCamp article&lt;/a&gt; provided a great walkthrough of what to do to deploy the back end of the app. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/gregpetropoulos/render-deployment-free-tier-of-mern-app-52mk&quot;&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; was also helpful, since it explained how to set up a full stack app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-need-a-front-end-and-back-end-site&quot;&gt;You need a front end and back end site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that was nice about Heroku was I could upload the front and back end in one project. It was easy for the front end to make requests to the back end using simple routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my first app in Render, I set up a “Web Service” and connected my GitHub repo. This worked very well and was up and running quickly. When I opened the link, however, I just got “not found”. All I was doing by visiting the link was making a request to the root of the app “/”. I added “/getArticles” to the url, which is a route in my app, and then received the data I was expecting. Great! Except all I was getting was raw JSON and there was no front end. This had to be done separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I set up a “Static Site”, pointing to the front end code in my repo. I realized that I would need to make requests to the same url I had just used in the browser. This was relatively simple to do. I just added an env variable in Render, and referred to it in my front end code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cors&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, because I now had different urls for the front end and back end, I was now running into CORS issues. This is because the default behavior of CORS is to not allow requests to go through if they are being sent from a different origin than the app receiving the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was fixed by installing a CORS package in the back end, giving permission to the front end url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//inside the server.js file&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cors&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//real link is an env variable in Render&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ORIGIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent much longer on this than necessary. I kept getting the same CORS error over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was because I added an extra “/” on the end of my url, like this: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://juliachack-dev-blog.netlify.app/&lt;/code&gt;, when the real origin had no “/” on the end &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://juliachack-dev-blog.netlify.app&lt;/code&gt;. A silly mistake, but it was the reason my app and the origin “didn’t match”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like a bit too much work to have to set up two different deployments for one full stack app, and it’s possible I’m missing something. Maybe there is another way that I didn’t see. Otherwise, maybe one day it will require only one deployment. Overall it was a good experience setting up my apps on Render.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New jekyll site part 3 - errors with deployment" />

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-3">&lt;p&gt;I made my changes to CSS without any more problems and I cleaned up my markdown files, as I mentioned last time. I figured now would be as good a time as any to deploy. I can keep adding posts and making small adjustments once deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there have been errors with this as well. As expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my github repo and pushed my code using command line. I used the following commands and this worked without errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git init&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git add .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git commit -m “first commit”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git remote add origin https://github.com/jchack1/julia-blog2.git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git push -u origin master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to deploy with Netlify, which is my go to for any deployment. It’s usually pretty straightforward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/&quot;&gt;and you can find the instructions for deploying Jekyll with Netlify here.&lt;/a&gt;  I selected my github repo and clicked deploy. After a few minutes I got an error, saying the build failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is because Netlify was looking for the _site folder.  I checked my files and I saw that I did not have this.  By now I’m getting pretty frustrated with this theme because it feels like there was a lot missing and unexplained. Why isn’t there a _site folder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; looking for any information about the _site folder.  I saw that when you use the command “jekyll build”, Jekyll builds the site and outputs it to a directory called _site, which is viewable in the browser at localhost:4000. I have used the “jekyll build” command many times so far, so I was unsure why it’s not in my files.  And why I was able to serve my site to localhost:4000.  I decided to see what would happen if I make a new Jekyll folder from scratch and run “jekyll build”. In my previous sites I always had a _site folder and never gave any thought to how it was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I decided to just follow my old notes rather than just copy-paste from my theme. I went into the Jekyll folder I already have on my machine and opened command line. I used the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jekyll new julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cd julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bundle exec jekyll build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the files in the folders and there it was. Once I used the jekyll build command, my _site folder appeared. Perhaps this was my mistake from the beginning. I never intiallized my folder properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to check both folders now, to see if I could either update my blog scripts to create the _site file, or if I’d need to copy everything over into my new folder. Whatever I tried in my old folder did not work, so I ended up copying everything over into my new folder. I set up gulp, which was really quick this time since I knew what I was doing. When I executed “bundle exec jekyll build” I now ended up with a _site folder, and it was filled with the proper files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will upload this new folder to github and deploy. It should work now that I have a proper _site folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have to remember to always “bundle exec jekyll build” and “bundle exec jekyll serve”(to generate files in _site folder) when I make changes. But only after I execute “gulp”. Hopefully I will quickly get used to this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
