      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new-jekyll-site-3">&lt;p&gt;I made my changes to CSS without any more problems and I cleaned up my markdown files, as I mentioned last time. I figured now would be as good a time as any to deploy. I can keep adding posts and making small adjustments once deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there have been errors with this as well. As expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my github repo and pushed my code using command line. I used the following commands and this worked without errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git init&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git add .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git commit -m “first commit”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git remote add origin https://github.com/jchack1/julia-blog2.git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;git push -u origin master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to deploy with Netlify, which is my go to for any deployment. It’s usually pretty straightforward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/&quot;&gt;and you can find the instructions for deploying Jekyll with Netlify here.&lt;/a&gt;  I selected my github repo and clicked deploy. After a few minutes I got an error, saying the build failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is because Netlify was looking for the _site folder.  I checked my files and I saw that I did not have this.  By now I’m getting pretty frustrated with this theme because it feels like there was a lot missing and unexplained. Why isn’t there a _site folder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; looking for any information about the _site folder.  I saw that when you use the command “jekyll build”, Jekyll builds the site and outputs it to a directory called _site, which is viewable in the browser at localhost:4000. I have used the “jekyll build” command many times so far, so I was unsure why it’s not in my files.  And why I was able to serve my site to localhost:4000.  I decided to see what would happen if I make a new Jekyll folder from scratch and run “jekyll build”. In my previous sites I always had a _site folder and never gave any thought to how it was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I decided to just follow my old notes rather than just copy-paste from my theme. I went into the Jekyll folder I already have on my machine and opened command line. I used the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jekyll new julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cd julia-blog3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bundle exec jekyll build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the files in the folders and there it was. Once I used the jekyll build command, my _site folder appeared. Perhaps this was my mistake from the beginning. I never intiallized my folder properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to check both folders now, to see if I could either update my blog scripts to create the _site file, or if I’d need to copy everything over into my new folder. Whatever I tried in my old folder did not work, so I ended up copying everything over into my new folder. I set up gulp, which was really quick this time since I knew what I was doing. When I executed “bundle exec jekyll build” I now ended up with a _site folder, and it was filled with the proper files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will upload this new folder to github and deploy. It should work now that I have a proper _site folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have to remember to always “bundle exec jekyll build” and “bundle exec jekyll serve”(to generate files in _site folder) when I make changes. But only after I execute “gulp”. Hopefully I will quickly get used to this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
