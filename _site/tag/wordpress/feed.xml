      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/wordpress-set-up">&lt;p&gt;We learned WordPress in school briefly as part of our CMS course. I could possibly get to work on some small freelance WordPress projects in the near future so I am relearning WordPress again with the site builder Oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-wordpress-and-installing-a-new-site&quot;&gt;Setting up Wordpress and installing a new site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had xampp installed from school.  To run a Wordpress site locally you need a few things installed, including a server and a database.  xampp has those all packaged together when you install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of articles online with instructions for this, but I followed my class notes - they are currently located &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acidtone/wbdv-fall-2019/tree/master/cpnt200/chapters/ch01&quot;&gt;here on my instructor’s github&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully this repo will be around for a while but I will also explain the process here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html&quot;&gt;apachefriends.org&lt;/a&gt; and download xampp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the xampp control panel - I have a shortcut on my desktop to the control panel to make it easier to locate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click “Start” for both Apache and MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click “Admin” next to MySQL. This opens up localhost/phpmyadmin/ where you can create a database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click “New”, input the name you would like for your database, and click “Create”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download WordPress from &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/download/&quot;&gt;wordpress.org&lt;/a&gt; and unzip into C:/ProgramFiles/XAMPP/htdocs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rename the WordPress folder to what you’d like your site name to be&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go into your WordPress files and find wp-config-sample.php. Rename to wp-config.php&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open wp-config.php in your code editor update the database name to whatever you named your database, change the user to root, and leave password as an empty string&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to your browser and type localhost/{your-site-name}&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose your language, and on the next screen fill in your site title, username, password, and email. You should now be able to log in and see your WordPress dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have errors logging in or opening all these pages, and that tends to be due to database errors.  When I set up my latest install of WordPress earlier this week, the password I set in my wp-config.php was not the same as the root password, which I set months ago and forgot about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also when I am typing this today I am not at home, I am at a cafe.  I cannot open localhost/phpmyadmin/ and I suspect it is because I am in a different place that is not whitelisted in my xampp set up. It is not super critical because it seems like I can still log into my site and work on it, but this could become problematic if I need to adjust something with my database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions-for-logging-into-wordpress-after-it-is-set-up&quot;&gt;Instructions for logging into Wordpress (after it is set up)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already forgot how to do this after a few days, so I am leaving this here for future me for when I inevitably forget again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open xampp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;start Apache and MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;go to browser&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;type localhost/{your-site-name}/wp-admin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;login&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you are at your site’s admin dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
