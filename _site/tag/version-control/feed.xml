      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sourcetree-authentication-error">&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn’t feel incompetent every time I struggle with some kind of error or bug; dealing with frustration comes with being a developer, and I chose this. This issue, however, frustrated me more than I care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I had to change the password on my work PC. Something I believe I have done many times before with no consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later I wanted to push some code in Sourcetree. Before commiting my changes I needed to do a pull. When I did so, I got the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/sourcetree-error.jpg&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px;&quot; alt=&quot;sourcetree error message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“fatal: Authentication failed for …”, plus a message from git at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing “authentication” made me think it was probably due to changing my password. I logged into our remote Bitbucket server with the new password. That worked fine. I came back to Sourcetree. Same error occured. I exited and reopened the program. Same error when I try to pull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started asking coworkers and searching online for solutions. There was actually a solution on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/Getting-quot-fatal-Authentication-failed-for-quot-error/qaq-p/624663&quot;&gt;Atlassian community forum&lt;/a&gt; that involved navigating from C: -&amp;gt; User -&amp;gt; [myusername] -&amp;gt; AppData -&amp;gt; Local -&amp;gt; Atlassian -&amp;gt; Sourcetree and finding the “passwd” file, and deleting it.  I got stuck on “AppData” which was conveniently not showing up in the folder I expected it. I figured this was because I was using a work PC, and I didn’t have this folder. I kept looking for other solutions, getting suggestions from coworkers, and nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I feel dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworker suggested the above solution. Once again I could not find the AppData file.  This time, though, I decided to just search for “passwd” in the search bar on the C drive. And the file showed up with the file path shown above. For whatever reason I couldn’t see it in the other view in file explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deleted this file and tried to pull again. A modal popped up asking for my new password. As you would expect, this worked. No error. The pull worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly sure what the moral of the story is. Don’t give up your search too early? It’s ok to feel dumb?  Instructions for the next time I deal with this error?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, let’s just go with that.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
