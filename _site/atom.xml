        <title>When Sourcetree didn't work - 'fatal: authentication failed' error</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn’t feel incompetent every time I struggle with some kind of error or bug; dealing with frustration comes with being a developer, and I chose this. This issue, however, frustrated me more than I care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes on jQuery</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have seen jQuery all over the place, including at work, but I have never taken the time to learn it in depth.  I figured I needed to do this soon, and there happens to be a section in my current Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course. Here are some of my notes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New jekyll site part 3 - errors with deployment</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I made my changes to CSS without any more problems and I cleaned up my markdown files, as I mentioned last time. I figured now would be as good a time as any to deploy. I can keep adding posts and making small adjustments once deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making a new jekyll site - this one, actually</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m going to do that thing again where I blog my experience of making a blog. At least I can feel like I am writing something for a reader, a pretend social interaction during week 3 of social distancing, though I suspect no one will read this except myself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The importance of a hard refresh</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was working on a task for my practicum.  The task was to add a delete button to two of the pages and ensure it redirected to the correct page once an item was deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are a few errors I received while working on a .NET application, and how I solved them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Entity Framework, workflows, databases, and migrations</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When I began my Udemy course on .NET MVC, as well as my web development practicum, there were a lot of terms I was unfamiliar with - things that perhaps seem very simple to more advanced developers.  I was constantly having to google new terms I came across, and often the language used in the articles I read was not beginner enough for me.  In this post I will simply share some definitions and bits of information I found helpful when I was just starting to learn about .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beginning to learn .NET</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently in the middle of the practicum component of my program. I am entering week 3 of 8, and to be honest I still have a lot of learning to do in order to be useful here.  I have already learned a lot of things that were not taught in my program, which I guess is the point of working in a real office. It hasn’t been easy and I suspect it will continue that way.&lt;/p&gt;
