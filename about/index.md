My name is Julia and I am a junior web developer.

While I was completing my certificate in web development I created my first Jekyll blog and made blog posts about the experience. Blogging my experience learning a new technology was more fun than I expected, and I actually returned to those posts later on when I needed a refresher on Jekyll.

I decided to make this Jekyll blog to track my web development journey.  Here I will log information I find useful, notes about new technologies I am learning, and solutions to problems I encounter. I intend for this to be like an online notebook, and a place I can look back to in the future to see how far I have come. 

As mentioned, this site is built with Jekyll. The theme I am using is Jasper2, a port of Casper2 created by Ghost.
