Starting a new UX/UI course with a focus on Adobe XD. Here are some notes I found helpful.

- my icons used to act strangely when I would try to resize them in XD. When your icon is selected, toggle "Responsive Resize" in the bar on the right
- to lock objects in place: ctrl + L
- to pan around your screen: space bar + click, mouse turns into a hand
- material.io - made by Google, good to find icons, design articles, etc - good UI resource
- iconfinder.com - another place to get icons
