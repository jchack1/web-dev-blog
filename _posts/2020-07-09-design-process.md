Here I am learning about the common elements of the design process.

The instructor reiterated that this is about coming up with the process that works best for you and not to copy another designer's style. Make changes however you see fit.

There are four main steps in most processes: research (empathize), analyze (your reserach), ideate (generate ideas), test.

Mistakes people make/things people don't realize:
- there is a design process; need to do research, come up with ideas, etc. One can't just come up with an idea on the spot, work needs to go into it, and that takes the form of your design process.
- need to have an excess of research before you analyze, and need excess of ideas before you test them; it's imporant to be aware of as many problems that you are facing as possible, so you can proritize the most imporant ones. Solving some problems can also cause problems in other areas.
- each of these design phases require different types of thinking; divergence and convergence


Research and ideation are divergent, quantity over quantity, need to gather lots of data
Analysis and testing are convergent, need to focus on most important details, lots of time to think
