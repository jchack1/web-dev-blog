### Heaps

Minimum heap

Maximum heap

### Sliding window

Two pointers to iterate through an array. Can apply it in many places, very common.

It can help you to iterate through the array only once instead of `n` times. Can help you avoid nested for loops.

### Binary Search

If you are searching through some items, always check the middle item and see if it is bigger or smaller than what you're searching for. Then you can eliminate half the items, and keep doing this until you find what you're looking for.

Often you are given an array and have to search for a value.

O(log n)

### DFS and BFS

These are very common. Can be applied to trees, graphs, or more. Building blocks for more complex algorithms.

DFS - depth first search

BFS - breadth first search

### Recursion

Used in a lot of places - trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.

Takes extra memory, understand the call stack.

### Hashmaps

Pretty simple, but common.

One example is TwoSum.

Everything can basically be done in O(1) time - very efficient.
