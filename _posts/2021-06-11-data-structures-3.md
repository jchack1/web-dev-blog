This is the last section of intro to data structures. We are now getting into non-linear data structures.

Everything up to this point has been a linear structure. The next data structures to cover are trees.

Once again following along with (this video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg9ih6SVACc&t=7744s] and supplementing with other sources.

### Trees

Nodes in a tree have a hierarchical relationship. Nodes can point to multiple nodes instead of just one, like we saw in linked lists.
