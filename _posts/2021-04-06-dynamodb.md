This month I'm going a bit deeper into DynamoDB.

I wasn't planning to, but I saw a free course available on A Cloud Guru and thought I would try out their platform as I have heard good things. DynamoDB is the database we use at work and I feel like I am still grasping the topics, so this is a great opportunity to learn more.

Like many of my other posts these days I'll be taking some notes while I do this, and maybe try to tie things back to serverless as well.
