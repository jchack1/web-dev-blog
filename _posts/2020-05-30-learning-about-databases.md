I often feel I need to drill this information into my head a few times before I really get it, so here are some more notes with basic definitions surrounding databases. These notes are from the database section of my Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course.

### Database

A collection of information or data that you access using an interface - not just any file with information. An interface here means that you use code to interact with the database.

For example, SQL is an interface to some databases.

### Relational(SQL) vs. non-relational(No-SQL) databases

Relational databases are "tabular" databases and are considered flat. You have to define what your tables look like first, and the relationships between the tables. You define relationships by creating a new table, called a join table. Relational databases are not very flexible if you want to make changes later. 

For non-relational databases you don't have to define these patterns ahead of time, so they are more flexible. There are no tables. They can have nested data so are therefore not flat.

### MongoDB

We are using it in the Udemy course, and we used it in my certificate program as well. It's because it is currently the most popular database to use with Node.js.
